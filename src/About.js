        <p>Visit California. Our mission is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world. Why did we start with California? It just couldn't be any other way. You see, California is our beautiful homeland, which makes it a perfect landmark to start our adventures. We're trying to popularize the idea of traveling that doesn't require fancy hotels, expensive flight tickets, or weeks of PTO (paid time off). We want to make exploring breathtaking places as easy and as common as possible. All we do is raise awareness of the places that once captured our hearts and happened to be all in one state. Sure we all can have dreams about traveling the world with perfect destinations, but it may take years till the perfect opportunity will present itself. When real life happens and you realize,  you can't have it all, we're here to remind you, that traveling doesn't have to be only a dream that is too far, or too expensive to reach. We're here to inspire you to get out there in nature and explore. Don't wait for the stars to align, just wait till the next available weekend, take your favorite people, friends, or family, and go make memories in places that are close to where you live. We hope we'll be the reason people will enjoy to unplug and cherish the present, as it's important to live while you're alive. </p>
